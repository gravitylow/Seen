"Ever wanted to know when someone was last playing? With seen, you can find out when the person was last on the server, specifically their last logout time, down to the minute. Anyone can use it to find out if their friend had just gotten off, or when the server admin was last online. If you want to find out when a player's first connection to the server was, that info is also available via /seen.

Server admins can also use this plugin to find any players that might have quit playing on the server, and delete any info, files, locks, or anything that is taking up space that is associated with the player.

If your a complete nerd, you can see how long you have spent on the specific server by using /playtime."
